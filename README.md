## Visualization of simple sorting algorithms

This is my visualization of some simple sorting algorithms using Typescript, React and Redux.   

You can choose an array type (random, nearly sorted, reversed array and an array with a few unique elements), sorting algorithm (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort) and animation speed.
